selenium-webdriver-slug
=======================

Starter project for getting rolling with Selenium Webdriver and PhantomJS

To get started, clone the repo. Do an 'npm install'. Then run 'make test-functional'. You'll see a small number of functional tests run in phantomjs. Now run 'make test-functional-all' and you'll see the same tests run in phantomjs, chrome, and firefox. 

Now take this project and build on it!
